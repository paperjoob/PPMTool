# PPMTool

This project was created with Spring Boot on the back-end and React on the front-end and styled with Bootstrap. 
<br/>
Database is MySQL.

To run this application, download the zipped file. Run "npm install" in your IDE for the react-client.
<br/>
For Spring Boot, run the Maven program with "mvn spring-boot:run" in the Terminal. (I used IntelliJ for this application)

Other tools used are:
<br />
Spring Security, JSON Web Token (tokens that are used to authenticate users on applications - applications that use JWTS no longer have to hold cookies or other session data about their users), Redux, Sweet Alerts 2.
